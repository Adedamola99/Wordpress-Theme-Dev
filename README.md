🎨 WordPress Theme Development

A starter WordPress theme development project built with PHP, HTML, CSS, and WordPress template files. This repository is designed to help you learn how to build and customize WordPress themes, with example template files and structure typically used in WP theme development.  ￼

(Note: This README assumes a classic theme — adjust details if your project is specifically block-based.)


🧠 What This Is

This repo contains the beginnings of a WordPress theme — with core theme files such as index.php, template styles, and assets. WordPress themes control how a WordPress website looks and feels, generating page layouts dynamically based on content stored in the database.  ￼

📦 Features

✔ Basic theme skeleton with core WordPress files
✔ Customizable template structure ready for development
✔ Uses standard PHP, CSS & HTML for theme logic
✔ Ideal for learning WordPress theme development workflow  ￼

(You can expand this section later with features like navigation menus, sidebars, custom headers, etc., once you implement them.)
